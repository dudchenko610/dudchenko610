### 🧭 About me

I’m a software engineer and tech lead running an engineering agency of **up to 20 developers**, delivering **web and mobile solutions** for clients all over the world.

I focus on building **reliable, scalable systems**, setting up **production-ready cloud infrastructure**, and helping teams ship faster without cutting corners.

I enjoy projects where **architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability** actually matter.

<br/>

### 🏆 Highlights

- ⭐ **Top Rated on Upwork**
- ⏱ **10,000+ hours worked** with real production systems
- 👥 Leading distributed teams across multiple time zones
- ✍️ Author of technical articles read by thousands of developers
- 🧩 Creator of a Blazor component ecosystem

### ✍️ Writing & Knowledge Sharing

I regularly write about **real-world engineering problems**, not toy examples:

- Native MapLibre / Mapbox in MAUI Hybrid
- Advanced Blazor UI patterns (modals, components, interop)
- Integrating npm tooling into .NET ecosystems
- Mobile + web cross-platform architecture

I believe good engineers **document, share, and challenge ideas**.
